# FamilyPhotoSharingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

In this first series of five, we will build our Family Photo Sharing App using Angular and Firebase. 

All the source code for this Series is available here:
https://github.com/EASV/Family-Photo-Sharing-App---Series-1.git

When we are done with all 5 series we will have created an Augmented Reality Family Photo Sharing App that can receive Gesture movements from a Raspberry Pi using the following technologies:
Angular 5+ - Building an Advanced Web App
Firebase 3+ - Storing all our data, handling Auth and Hosting our Angular App
Ionic 3+ - Building a Mobile App
Vuforia and Unity for Augmented Reality - See photos through a Tablet / Ipad
Raspberry Pi for Internet of Things - Gestures

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
